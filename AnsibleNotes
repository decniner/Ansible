#installing ansible
yum install ansible

#ansible is a push type configuration management tool. 
It means the entire control lies with your master or your server system. 
This is where you write your configuration file and 
these are also responsible for pushing your configuration files onto your node or client system when required.

#we can create a host file where we specify our target node or client machines
gedit etc/var/host
